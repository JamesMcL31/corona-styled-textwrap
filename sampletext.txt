<p>One of the most distinguishing features of this species is the bold dark-bars draped across the dorsal surface. Additional dark spots are found along the lateral surfaces of the species. In adult specimens, the pectoral fins are broadly triangular.</p>
<p>The caudal fin is elongate, and lacks a lower lobe altogether. This species is an active, strong swimming shark, often observed moving with an undulating motion. They are known to form large schools, occasionally aggregating with gray or brown smooth-hound sharks (<em>Mustelus californicus</em> and <em>M. henlei</em>) and piked dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>).</p>
